    "I have found that many students are eager to find a date during the stressful school life. They post flyer on Price Center, lecture halls, and other places around the campus to find their perfect ones. This offers me an insight to create a group of data analysis code. I want to create a system that gather their personal information and match them in pairs. In this system, personalized and highly matched attributes enable students to more effectively find their partner on the campus, which could help them satisfy their demands."

    "This project provides a questionnaire that the user must copy word by word to collect data from his/her targeted audience. When the data is collected, the user could use the code in this project to generate results for all of the participants to find their best matching dating options.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use the class Person to convert every participate into a python object, so as to more easily and conveniently perform the matching algorithm on them. The scores for each participant are also self-included in the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, after all of the matching algorithms are performed and the scores are finalized, the matching scores for each person is then concatenated into a single Dataframe, which then could be used to convert to any physical form, like Excel, as needed.\n",
    "The project utilizes and relies on Python library Pandas to convert between Python objects and Dataframe and Excel forms. Everything else is done only in the python standard library, as have taught in the class."
